# USER PROFILING AND RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS USING USER GENERATED CONTENT

This project aims at reducing marketing cost by using sentiment analysis techniques. User generated content for 1 year has been obtained from the online social platform, Reddit. The information is processed and a list of reddit users that are influencers and potential clients to a particular product are extracted. Those are used as inputs to a user recommender system web application. This application will be made available to vendors so that they can directly contact and make advertising to users that are interested in their brand or product. The second phase of the project is to perform the score prediction of a post; for Reddit social platform, 'score' is defined as the number of upvotes against the number of downvotes. Using various posts' attributes, different machine learning algorithms have been used for score prediction. The output allows us determine whether there is a relationship between an influencer and score of his post.

## User recommender system web application

This interface allows the user to select their desired category and brand from the drop down menu. Using the find button the user can then generate a list of user names that are a potential customer for the selected brand. Using the influencers tab, the user can navigate to find the list of user names that are influencers. The user is able to print the entire list by using the print command or, print specific entries by selecting the entries using the checkbox and then use the print command to print the entries.

## Score prediction command based interface
The objective of this user interface is to predict the score of a reddit post even before getting the upvotes and downvotes from the other Reddit users. It is a command-based interface that allows end-users to key in details related to a post and obtain a score accordingly. The score is classified as 'High', 'Low' and 'neutral' and the information to be entered are as follows: number of comments to the post, ratio of gaps for an author (his activeness), number of posts of the author, sentiment score of the post, the sentiment ratio (positive sentiment: negative sentiment) and score of comments to the post.
