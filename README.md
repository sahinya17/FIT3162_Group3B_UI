## Score prediction command based interface
The objective of this user interface is to predict the score of a reddit post even before getting the upvotes and downvotes from the other Reddit users. It is a command-based interface that allows end-users to key in details related to a post and obtain a score accordingly. The score is classified as 'High', 'Low' and 'neutral' and the information to be entered are as follows: number of comments to the post, ratio of gaps for an author (his activeness), number of posts of the author, sentiment score of the post, the sentiment ratio (postive sentiment: negative sentiment) and score of comments to the post.
